<p class="highlight">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
 printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
 industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an 
 unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make 
 a type specimen book. </p>
 <p class="highlight">
 It has survived not only five centuries, 
 but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
 essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
 the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem 
Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem 
Ipsum.</p>
